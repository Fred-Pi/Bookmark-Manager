# Icon Placeholders

For now, use any bookmark-related PNG images (16x16, 48x48, 128x128) and save them in the `icons/` folder.

You can:
1. Download free bookmark icons from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/search?word=bookmark)
2. Use [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) to generate from text (use a "B" or bookmark emoji 🔖)
3. Create your own using any image editor

Rename the files to:
- `icon16.png`
- `icon48.png`
- `icon128.png`

The extension will work fine without them during development, but Chrome will show a warning.
